"""
This application is the client-side reference implementation of the
Client/Server model for interacting with databases via the server
sitting above the database.

This client is in no means *the* client, it simply uses the API
outlined by the server. You may use whichever client and in what
ever language you want. This is just a client to get you started
and see what kind of things you can do with the server implement-
ation.
