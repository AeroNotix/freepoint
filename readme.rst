QtSQLViewer
===========

QtSQLViewer is intended to be a client-side implementation of a sharepoint-like
system that I envision.

The overall idea is to replace Access applications linked with sharepoint tables
the reason for this is that Sharepoint is a very closed and clunky set of tools
not to mention to abhorrent liscencing that comes with it.

QtSQLViewer will be the first client side implementation of the API I have in
mind for this project.

* Data retrieval
