QtSQLViewer
===========

QtSQLViewer is intended to be a client-side implementation of a sharepoint-like
system that I envision.

The overall idea is to replace Access applications linked with sharepoint tables
the reason for this is that Sharepoint is a very closed and clunky set of tools
not to mention to abhorrent liscencing that comes with it.

QtSQLViewer will be the first client side implementation of the API I have in
mind for this project.

Server-Side
-----------

* Basic Authentication (real basic)
* Data retrieval
* Data updating
* JSON Marshaling

Client-side
-----------

* Open/View tables
* Edit data
* Create tables
* Manage connections


TODO:
-----

* Implement better authentication
* Figure out how to create Sphinx docs with Qt
* Get feedback from people/show people
* Add more datatypes
* Make the database creator more featureful
