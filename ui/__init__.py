"""
This module holds all of the UI forms.

Files ending: *_UI.py are the automatically generated files from Pyuic4
Files ending: *.ui are the raw QtDesigner files
Remainder files are where we have created the useable Python classes from
their *_UI.py files which makes them simply importable.
